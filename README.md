# pcaropi

This repository contains skills and extensions that I use in some form with projects.

It is released on npm as `pcaropi` for use with the Pi package loader.

## Structure

- `skills/`: Custom skills for Pi.
- `pi-extensions/`: Extensions for the Pi agent.
- `pi-themes/`: Themes for the Pi TUI.
- `commands/`: Custom scripts or commands.
